# PassMan - Password Manager App

I want to create a password manager app called PassMan. It would be an android app that doesn't connect to the internet.

## Stage 1

User could store passwords. The passwords would be encrypted in sha-512 before storing it in a sql lite database. App uses device password or biometric in the landing page. Once authenticated the user has access to all the passwords stored in the device.

## Stage 2

There would be an option to generate passwords. Password generation could be customized for length, inclusion of numbers, special symbols, and capital case letters.

## Considerations

It should be a small, fast and secure app.
